          <p><strong>Caustic soda.</strong> Measure 100ml of water ( tap water will do) and add quarter teaspoon of household caustic soda ( use cook measuring set for quarter of  a teaspoon).

          <p>Put a drop of either bleach (C) or dilute caustic soda (K)  on the scratched spot and watch for a colour change.</p></li>

          <p><strong>Bleach response:</strong> fast reaction  turning pink or red if positive but fading rapidly, signified by □ in the text .</p></li>
